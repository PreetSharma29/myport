She had been on a camping trip with her friends, but they had ventured off on a hike without her and she had become disoriented trying to find her way back to camp. The desert air was dry and hot, and Sarah was starting to feel dehydrated. She knew she needed to find water soon if she was going to make it through the night. Sarah started to walk in what she thought was the direction of the campsite, but the sand dunes seemed to shift and change with every step. She tried to follow the shadows cast by the mountains in the distance, but they too seemed to be constantly moving. Sarah was starting to panic. She had never been lost in the desert before, and the thought of spending the night alone in the harsh wilderness was overwhelming. As she continued to wander, Sarah spotted a group of cacti in the distance. She knew that some species of cactus contained water, and so she made her way over to investigate. Sure enough, as she approached the cacti, she saw that they were barrel cacti, and she could see the telltale signs of moisture on their skin. Sarah used her pocket knife to carefully cut into the cactus, and was relieved to see a small trickle of water emerge. It wasn't much, but it was enough to quench her thirst for the moment. With a renewed sense of hope, Sarah continued on her journey, walking steadily towards what she hoped was the campsite. The sun had now fully set, and the stars were beginning to twinkle in the sky. Sarah had always loved stargazing, and in any other circumstances, she would have enjoyed the spectacle. But tonight, she was too focused on survival to appreciate the beauty around her. Hours passed as Sarah stumbled through the sand, her mind growing hazy with exhaustion. Just as she was about to collapse from fatigue, she saw a flicker of light in the distance. She quickened her pace, her heart racing with hope. As she drew closer, she could make out the outline of the campsite, and the familiar faces of her friends gathered around a fire. Sarah stumbled into camp, her friends rushing to her side to offer her water and food. She collapsed onto the ground, tears streaming down her face from relief and exhaustion. She had made it through the night, and she knew she would never take the beauty of the desert for granted again.\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 6,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this)\n  }, void 0, false, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 5,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }, this);\n};\n_c = Works;\nexport default Works;\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"Works\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","jsxDEV","_jsxDEV","Works","children","fileName","_jsxFileName","lineNumber","columnNumber","_c","$RefreshReg$"],"sources":["/Users/preetsharma/Desktop/Portfolio/my-portfolio/src/Components/Works/Works.jsx"],"sourcesContent":["import React from 'react'\n\nconst Works = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>\n      As the sun began to set over the vast desert landscape, Sarah found herself alone and lost.

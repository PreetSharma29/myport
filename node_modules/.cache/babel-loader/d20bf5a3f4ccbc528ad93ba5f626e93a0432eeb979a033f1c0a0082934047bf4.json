She had been cooped up inside all winter, and now she was excited to finally be able to go for a walk and explore the new park that had just opened up down the street.\n// As she strolled along the path, Sarah noticed a group of children playing a game of tag in the nearby field. She smiled as she watched them run around, their laughter echoing through the park. It reminded her of her own childhood, and she felt a twinge of nostalgia.\n// Continuing on, Sarah came across a group of older men playing chess at a nearby picnic table. They were engrossed in their game, their faces etched with concentration. Sarah was impressed by their skill, and she paused to watch them for a few moments before moving on.\n// As she walked, Sarah noticed the different types of trees and flowers that lined the park. She wasn't much of a botanist, but she appreciated the beauty of nature nonetheless. She made a mental note to look up some of the species she had seen once she got home.\n// As she neared the edge of the park, Sarah noticed a man sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. He looked lost in thought, and Sarah wondered what was going through his mind. She debated whether or not to approach him, but ultimately decided against it and continued on her way.\n// As she turned to head back home, Sarah saw a young couple walking hand-in-hand towards her. They looked happy and carefree, and Sarah couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy. She had been single for a while now, and sometimes she missed the feeling of being in love.\n// Finally reaching her apartment, Sarah let out a sigh of contentment. She felt refreshed and rejuvenated after her walk in the park. She made a cup of tea and settled down on her couch, feeling grateful for the small moments of joy and beauty that she had experienced that day.\n//     </p>\nvar _c;\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"Works\");","map":{"version":3,"names":["React","Garena","skills","greetings","international","kargil","parents","nelson","nature","webd","motion","jsxDEV","_jsxDEV","Works","children","fileName","_jsxFileName","lineNumber","columnNumber","src","alt","_c","$RefreshReg$"],"sources":["/Users/preetsharma/Desktop/Portfolio/my-portfolio/src/Components/Works/Works.jsx"],"sourcesContent":["import React from 'react'\nimport Garena from '../../img/GARENA BATTLE.png';\nimport skills from '../../img/5skills.jpg';\nimport greetings from '../../img/greetings.jpg';\nimport international from '../../img/International Friendship Day.jpeg';\nimport kargil from '../../img/Kargil Vijay Diwas.jpeg';\nimport parents from '../../img/National__Parents__Day.jpg';\nimport nelson from '../../img/Nelson_M._International_day.png';\nimport nature from '../../img/World Nature Conservation Day.jpeg';\nimport webd from '../../img/Web__development.jpg';\nimport {motion} from \"framer-motion\";\nimport './Works.css';\n\nconst Works = () => {\n  return (\n      <div>\n        <h1>Works</h1>\n         <img src={Garena} alt=\"\" />\n         <img src={skills} alt=\"\" />\n         <img src={greetings} alt=\"\" />\n         <img src={international} alt=\"\" />\n         <img src={kargil} alt=\"\" />\n         <img src={parents} alt=\"\" />\n         <img src={nelson} alt=\"\" />\n         <img src={nature} alt=\"\" />\n         <img src={webd} alt=\"\" />\n      </div>   \n  )\n}\n\nexport default Works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n// <p>\n//       The sun shone brightly as Sarah stepped outside, taking a deep breath of the fresh spring air.
